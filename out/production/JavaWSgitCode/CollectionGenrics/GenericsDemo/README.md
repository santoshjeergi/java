Generic were introduced to solve the problem of type safety checks of object,
Helps to prgmers to catch problem at compile time.

It strenghtens type safety
It allows programmers to write generic algorithms and data structures.
Same class can be used to represent any data type.

On Class
Stack<String> i.e Stack<T>

Map<String, String> i.e Map<T, E>

On Methods

Bounded Genrics
want to limit restrict  

Generics don not accept primitive types. 
accepts only objects
